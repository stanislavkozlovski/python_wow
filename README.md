The game itself is turn-based and works through user text commands.
The goal with this pet project is to create a somewhat complex game with good code structure, tests and documentation but most important of all: to learn how to handle a project bigger than 500 lines of code.
It's still very basic and I suggest that you download it and play around to see what it's about.
I have never had another project open to contributors before, so if anything is unclear or needs improvement please contact me - familyguyuser192@windowslive.com
